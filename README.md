# pyYBJ

Here we solve a 3D version of the YBJ equation [[1]](#1) pseudospectrally using a periodic domain in the horizontal and a finite domain in the vertical which is achieved through the use of a Chebyshev basis. The YBJ equation describes the evolution of the near-inertial wave (NIW) field in the presence of mesoscale eddies. Using a 3D simulation allows us to capture the effects of variable stratification and vertical energy fluxes on the evolution of the NIW field. We use observational profiles of the stratification and mesoscale eddy field in order to attempt to replicate observations as part of the Ocean Sub-Mesoscale, Ocean Surface Mixing (OSMOSIS) project.
